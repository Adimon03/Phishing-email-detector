## 🎓 Learning Value

### What This Sample Teaches:

1. **Not All Marketing is Phishing**
   - Aggressive marketing ≠ phishing
   - Legitimate companies can be pushy
   - Context matters

2. **Verify Unknown Senders**
   - Research the company
   - Check reviews and reputation
   - Look for business registration

3. **Be Cautious, Not Paranoid**
   - Some emails are just aggressive marketing
   - Use judgment and research
   - Don't automatically trust or distrust

4. **Red Flags vs Deal Breakers**
   - Urgency = red flag (be cautious)
   - Fake domain = deal breaker (definitely phishing)
   - Requests for passwords = deal breaker
